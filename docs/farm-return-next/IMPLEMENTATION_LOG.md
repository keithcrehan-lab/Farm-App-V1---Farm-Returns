# Farm Return Next — implementation log

Running log, one entry per checkpoint/significant action, oldest first.
Mirrors `docs/real-mode-completion/BUILD_LOG.md`'s role for V1 — this is
the file a resuming agent (or a human) reads to know what actually
happened, not just what was planned.

## Checkpoint 0 — autonomous framework established

Branch `farm-return-next`, cut from tag `v1-baseline-2026-08-29`
(`9c8a952b77227ddfbd44c7efabf8e5bdd06c77f4`), per the product owner's
instruction to establish and smoke-test the autonomous engineering
framework before any feature implementation.

**Created:**
- `CLAUDE.md` — updated in place: V1's canonical principles/Never rules/
  metadata rules preserved verbatim (they still govern Next); build-order
  section rewritten to point at `BUILD_PLAN.md` instead of V1's now-
  complete Phase 0-8 list; new Next-specific never-rules added (no merge
  to `main`, no production deploy/migration, no force-push/history
  rewrite, no progressing past an unresolved Critical/High audit finding).
- `AGENTS.md` — new, tool-agnostic mirror of `CLAUDE.md`'s operating rules
  for any agent (Codex included) working in this repo.
- `docs/farm-return-next/{MASTER_SPEC,ARCHITECTURE,DOMAIN_CONTRACTS,
  UX_DESIGN,SCIENTIFIC_RULES,BUILD_PLAN,BLOCKERS}.md`,
  `BUILD_STATE.json`, this file.
- `scripts/quality-gate.sh` — wraps `npm test`/`typecheck`/`lint`/`build`.
- `scripts/codex-audit.sh` — wraps `codex review` (OpenAI Codex CLI,
  confirmed installed and authenticated in this environment,
  `~/.npm-global/bin/codex`, ChatGPT auth) against a diff, requiring
  Critical/High findings to be explicitly labelled per
  `BUILD_PLAN.md`'s taxonomy.
- `scripts/autopilot.sh` — supervisor loop: reads `BUILD_STATE.json`,
  invokes headless Claude (`claude -p`, confirmed installed,
  `~/.local/bin/claude`) for the next unit of work, runs the quality gate,
  runs the Codex audit, commits on a clean pass, updates state/log, retries
  with backoff on a rate-limit-shaped failure instead of giving up.

**Smoke-tested** (framework only, no feature work, per the instruction to
establish and smoke-test the framework this session and not begin
uncontrolled feature implementation):
- `scripts/codex-audit.sh --smoke-test` — a real `codex exec --sandbox
  read-only` call (not a mock/simulated one), authenticated via the
  installed Codex CLI's existing ChatGPT login, model `gpt-5.6-sol`,
  returned the expected `CODEX_SMOKE_TEST_OK` token, 4,784 tokens used,
  exit 0. This proves the Codex-as-independent-reviewer mechanism is
  reachable and working end-to-end; it did not run a real checkpoint
  audit (no diff existed yet to review) — that's Checkpoint 1's exit
  gate.
- `scripts/autopilot.sh --smoke-test` — a real headless `claude -p`
  invocation, returned the expected `CLAUDE_SMOKE_TEST_OK` token, exit 0.
  Proves the headless-Claude supervisor mechanism is reachable; it made
  no repo changes (the smoke-test mode is deliberately a no-op prompt).

Both raw logs are gitignored (`docs/farm-return-next/{audit-logs,
autopilot-logs}/`) — ephemeral run evidence, this log entry is the durable
record.

**Quality gate:** `scripts/quality-gate.sh --json`, run for real —
961/961 tests (69/69 files), typecheck clean, lint clean, build clean
(24 routes). Full detail: `BUILD_STATE.json.last_quality_gate`.

**Not exercised this session** (deliberately, per the instruction to
establish and smoke-test only): `scripts/autopilot.sh`'s real loop mode
(only `--smoke-test` ran), a real `scripts/codex-audit.sh` checkpoint
audit against an actual diff (only `--smoke-test` ran, since Checkpoint 0
is docs/scripts, not the kind of product change the taxonomy in
`BUILD_PLAN.md` was written to gate — its first real audit is Checkpoint
1's exit gate), and any `src/orchestration/` code (doesn't exist yet).

Status: **complete.** See `BUILD_STATE.json` for the next action
(Checkpoint 1).
