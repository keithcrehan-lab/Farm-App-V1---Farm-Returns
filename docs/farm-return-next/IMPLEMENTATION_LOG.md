# Farm Return Next — implementation log

Running log, one entry per checkpoint/significant action, oldest first.
Mirrors `docs/real-mode-completion/BUILD_LOG.md`'s role for V1 — this is
the file a resuming agent (or a human) reads to know what actually
happened, not just what was planned.

## Checkpoint 0 — autonomous framework established

Branch `farm-return-next`, cut from tag `v1-baseline-2026-08-29`
(`9c8a952b77227ddfbd44c7efabf8e5bdd06c77f4`), per the product owner's
instruction to establish and smoke-test the autonomous engineering
framework before any feature implementation.

**Created:**
- `CLAUDE.md` — updated in place: V1's canonical principles/Never rules/
  metadata rules preserved verbatim (they still govern Next); build-order
  section rewritten to point at `BUILD_PLAN.md` instead of V1's now-
  complete Phase 0-8 list; new Next-specific never-rules added (no merge
  to `main`, no production deploy/migration, no force-push/history
  rewrite, no progressing past an unresolved Critical/High audit finding).
- `AGENTS.md` — new, tool-agnostic mirror of `CLAUDE.md`'s operating rules
  for any agent (Codex included) working in this repo.
- `docs/farm-return-next/{MASTER_SPEC,ARCHITECTURE,DOMAIN_CONTRACTS,
  UX_DESIGN,SCIENTIFIC_RULES,BUILD_PLAN,BLOCKERS}.md`,
  `BUILD_STATE.json`, this file.
- `scripts/quality-gate.sh` — wraps `npm test`/`typecheck`/`lint`/`build`.
- `scripts/codex-audit.sh` — wraps `codex review` (OpenAI Codex CLI,
  confirmed installed and authenticated in this environment,
  `~/.npm-global/bin/codex`, ChatGPT auth) against a diff, requiring
  Critical/High findings to be explicitly labelled per
  `BUILD_PLAN.md`'s taxonomy.
- `scripts/autopilot.sh` — supervisor loop: reads `BUILD_STATE.json`,
  invokes headless Claude (`claude -p`, confirmed installed,
  `~/.local/bin/claude`) for the next unit of work, runs the quality gate,
  runs the Codex audit, commits on a clean pass, updates state/log, retries
  with backoff on a rate-limit-shaped failure instead of giving up.

**Smoke-tested** (framework only, no feature work, per the instruction to
establish and smoke-test the framework this session and not begin
uncontrolled feature implementation):
- `scripts/codex-audit.sh --smoke-test` — a real `codex exec --sandbox
  read-only` call (not a mock/simulated one), authenticated via the
  installed Codex CLI's existing ChatGPT login, model `gpt-5.6-sol`,
  returned the expected `CODEX_SMOKE_TEST_OK` token, 4,784 tokens used,
  exit 0. This proves the Codex-as-independent-reviewer mechanism is
  reachable and working end-to-end; it did not run a real checkpoint
  audit (no diff existed yet to review) — that's Checkpoint 1's exit
  gate.
- `scripts/autopilot.sh --smoke-test` — a real headless `claude -p`
  invocation, returned the expected `CLAUDE_SMOKE_TEST_OK` token, exit 0.
  Proves the headless-Claude supervisor mechanism is reachable; it made
  no repo changes (the smoke-test mode is deliberately a no-op prompt).

Both raw logs are gitignored (`docs/farm-return-next/{audit-logs,
autopilot-logs}/`) — ephemeral run evidence, this log entry is the durable
record.

**Quality gate:** `scripts/quality-gate.sh --json`, run for real —
961/961 tests (69/69 files), typecheck clean, lint clean, build clean
(24 routes). Full detail: `BUILD_STATE.json.last_quality_gate`.

**Not exercised this session** (deliberately, per the instruction to
establish and smoke-test only): `scripts/autopilot.sh`'s real loop mode
(only `--smoke-test` ran), a real `scripts/codex-audit.sh` checkpoint
audit against an actual diff (only `--smoke-test` ran, since Checkpoint 0
is docs/scripts, not the kind of product change the taxonomy in
`BUILD_PLAN.md` was written to gate — its first real audit is Checkpoint
1's exit gate), and any `src/orchestration/` code (doesn't exist yet).

Status: **complete.** See `BUILD_STATE.json` for the next action
(Checkpoint 1).

## Checkpoint 1 — orchestration skeleton (in progress)

First unit of work: scaffold `src/orchestration/{observe,prompt,decide,
act,confirm,learn}/` per `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s layering diagram — typed
interfaces for all six stages, plus the one real implementation
`BUILD_PLAN.md`'s deliverable calls for ("e.g. `act/` calling one existing
`farm-data` mutation for one job type end-to-end, proving the layering
... actually works, not just documented"). The migration and Today screen
v0 deliverables are separate, still-outstanding units of this same
checkpoint.

**Created:**
- `src/orchestration/observe/index.ts` — `ObservedEvent`/`ObserveSource`
  types only (Vertical A's real GPS ingestion is a later checkpoint).
- `src/orchestration/prompt/index.ts` — `Prompt` type (`basis:
  EngineOutcome<unknown>`, generic over whatever `src/domain/*.ts`
  Estimate produced it) plus `describeBlockedBasis`, a real pure function
  that turns each non-`"OK"` `EngineOutcome` arm into honest Prompt copy —
  the only sanctioned way to describe a blocked Estimate in a Prompt, per
  `SCIENTIFIC_RULES.md`'s "never falls back to a plausible-sounding
  suggestion" rule.
- `src/orchestration/decide/index.ts` — `Decision` type
  (`decidedBy: "farmer" | "auto_rule"`, only `"farmer"` usable today per
  `SCIENTIFIC_RULES.md`'s auto-rule boundary/`BLOCKERS.md`) and
  `decideAsFarmer`, a real constructor.
- `src/orchestration/act/index.ts` — the checkpoint's one real,
  end-to-end job type: `actRecordWeightObservation` takes a `Decision`
  and calls the *existing* `farm-data/individual-animals.ts`'s
  `addWeightObservation` (unmodified, no new write path) to create a real
  `WeightObservation`. Fails closed (throws, doesn't call the mutation)
  on a Decision missing the required edits, mirroring the domain layer's
  own missing-input discipline. Chosen because it is V1's smallest
  existing mutation that already models a real farm event (an animal
  weighing) a Confirm-stage GPS job-mode action would plausibly record.
- `src/orchestration/confirm/index.ts` — `Confirmation`/`ConfirmMethod`
  types only (Vertical C's real GPS job mode UI is a later checkpoint).
- `src/orchestration/learn/index.ts` — `EstimateCalibration` type only
  (Vertical F's real reader/writer needs the migration and Vertical D's
  real Actuals first).
- Colocated tests: `prompt/index.test.ts` (all five non-`"OK"`
  `EngineOutcome` arms), `decide/index.test.ts` (`decideAsFarmer`'s
  accepted/dismissed shapes), `act/index.test.ts` (mocks
  `farm-data/individual-animals.ts`'s `addWeightObservation` the same way
  `farm-store.sync.test.tsx` already mocks a `server-only` mutation
  module without a real database — proves Act calls the real farm-data
  export with the right arguments, and fails closed on malformed/absent
  edits without ever calling it).

**Verified this unit** (not yet the full checkpoint exit gate —
`BUILD_PLAN.md` reserves `scripts/quality-gate.sh`/`scripts/codex-audit.sh`
for Checkpoint 1's exit, once the migration and Today screen v0 also
land): `npx vitest run` — 971/971 tests pass (72/72 files, the prior
961/69 plus 10 new/3); `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; `npx eslint
src/orchestration` clean. `next build` was not run this unit (`npm run
build`/`npx next build` both required interactive approval unavailable
in this session); low-risk to defer here since nothing in `src/app` or
`src/components` imports `src/orchestration/*` yet (no route/bundle can
be affected) and `tsc --noEmit` already covers the type-check phase a
build would otherwise catch — the real build run happens at the exit
gate regardless.

Status: **in progress.** Next: the `jobs`/`telemetry_events`/`decisions`/
`estimate_calibration` migration (Dev only), then Today screen v0.

## Checkpoint 1 — orchestration skeleton: first real `scripts/autopilot.sh`
## run, a real audit finding, and two fixes to the audit script itself

The product owner ran `caffeinate -dimsu ./scripts/autopilot.sh` for
real (1 iteration, no `--auto-push`) — the first non-smoke-test run of
the whole framework. Recorded here in full because it's the framework's
own first real self-test, not just this checkpoint's product work.

**What actually happened, honestly, including what went wrong:**

1. Headless `claude -p` did the orchestration-skeleton unit above (already
   logged) and correctly did **not** commit it itself.
2. `scripts/quality-gate.sh` ran for real and passed: 971/971 tests,
   typecheck/lint/build all clean.
3. `scripts/codex-audit.sh --uncommitted` then failed — not with a
   finding, but with a real bug in the script itself:
   `codex review --uncommitted "<prompt>"` is rejected by this Codex CLI
   version (`the argument '--uncommitted' cannot be used with '[PROMPT]'`
   — empirically, none of `--uncommitted`/`--base`/`--commit` combine
   with a custom prompt in codex-cli 0.150.1). The script correctly
   treated the CLI error as a failed audit and refused to commit — the
   fail-closed design worked exactly as intended, it just fired on a
   tooling bug rather than a real finding. **Nothing was committed.**
4. Fixed: `codex-audit.sh` rewritten to use `codex exec` (already proven
   in the Checkpoint 0 smoke test) with an explicit git-diff instruction
   instead of `codex review`'s scope flags, sidestepping the
   incompatibility entirely.
5. Re-ran the fixed script for real against the actual pending diff
   (Checkpoint 0's commit + this checkpoint's uncommitted work) — and it
   found a **real, legitimate HIGH finding**:
   `actRecordWeightObservation` checked `decision.edits`' shape but never
   `decision.outcome`/`decidedBy`, so a `"dismissed"` Decision that still
   happened to carry `edits`, or a structurally-valid
   `decidedBy: "auto_rule"` Decision, would have silently written a real
   record — exactly the unconfirmed-real-world-side-effect the
   Decide-stage boundary (`SCIENTIFIC_RULES.md`) forbids. Plus a MEDIUM
   (weak edit validation: NaN/infinite/zero/negative weight, empty-string
   id/date reached the mutation) and a MEDIUM on the audit script itself
   (its new git-diff instruction still couldn't show untracked file
   *contents*, only paths — the review would have missed all of
   `src/orchestration/` had Codex not enumerated it unprompted that run).
   Full findings: `docs/farm-return-next/audit-logs/20260829T001857Z.md`.
6. **Fixed all three**, per `BUILD_PLAN.md`'s "Critical or High found at a
   checkpoint audit blocks progression... until resolved" (the Medium on
   the script was cheap and directly improves future audits, so fixed
   too rather than only logged):
   - `act/index.ts`: `actRecordWeightObservation` now throws unless
     `decision.outcome` is `"accepted"`/`"edited"` **and**
     `decision.decidedBy === "farmer"` — unconditionally, not just
     because no auto-rule exists yet; and `parseRecordWeightObservationEdits`
     now rejects non-finite/non-positive weight and empty-string id/date.
   - `act/index.test.ts`: 6 new tests pin the fix directly — a dismissed
     Decision that still carries edits, a structurally-valid `auto_rule`
     Decision, and a parametrised case for each invalid-edit shape found
     (NaN/infinite/zero/negative weight, empty id, empty date). 1
     pre-existing test's expected error text updated to match (`"missing
     valid ..."`, not `"missing ..."`).
   - `codex-audit.sh`: the untracked-file instruction now explicitly
     handles the case git collapses an entire untracked directory to one
     `?? dir/` porcelain line (exactly what happened to
     `src/orchestration/`) — instructing Codex to recursively enumerate
     and read every file beneath such a directory, not just "the file."
7. Re-ran `scripts/quality-gate.sh` — 979/979 tests (72/72 files, +8 from
   the 6 new plus 2 parametrised-array expansions), typecheck/lint/build
   clean.
8. Re-ran `scripts/codex-audit.sh --uncommitted` (fixed script, against
   the fixed diff) — **CRITICAL=0, HIGH=0, MEDIUM=2, LOW=0**. Per
   `BUILD_PLAN.md`'s taxonomy this is a clean pass (Medium/Low don't
   block). The two Medium findings this run:
   - The directory-enumeration gap above — fixed immediately after (step
     6), so already closed by the time this entry was written; not
     re-audited a third time to confirm (would cost another real Codex
     round-trip for a change to the audit script's own prompt text, not
     the product code being gated — judged not worth it).
   - `prompt/index.ts`'s `Prompt` type doesn't *structurally* force a
     blocked `basis`'s `description` to come from `describeBlockedBasis`
     — a caller could hand-write a plausible-sounding description anyway.
     Real architectural point, correctly Medium (nothing constructs a
     real Prompt yet — `prompt/` is still types-only pending Vertical B).
     **Deferred, not fixed**: the right fix is a smart constructor
     alongside Vertical B's first real Prompt-producing function, not a
     types-only module reacting to a finding about code that doesn't
     exist yet. Logged here per `BUILD_PLAN.md`'s "Medium/Low ... picked
     up opportunistically" — Vertical B reads this entry before adding
     its first real Prompt constructor.
   Full findings: `docs/farm-return-next/audit-logs/20260829T002345Z.md`.

**Why this is being logged in this much detail**: this is the framework
validating itself under real conditions, not a smoke test — it caught a
real gap in generated product code (the HIGH), a real gap in its own
tooling (the CLI-incompatibility bug, twice), and correctly refused to
let either slip through uncommitted. That's the entire point of building
it this way.

**Committing this unit** now that quality gate + Codex audit are both
genuinely clean. `contracts_frozen` stays `true` (nothing in
`DOMAIN_CONTRACTS.md`'s frozen table changed; `Prompt`/`Decision`/`Act`
are new orchestration-layer types, not modifications to any existing
V1 export).

Status: **this unit complete and committed.** Checkpoint 1 overall still
**in progress** — migration and Today screen v0 remain.
